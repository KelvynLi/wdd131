                   2 And again, more blessed are they who shall believe in your words because that ye shall testify that ye
                   have seen me, and that ye know that I am. Yea, blessed are they who shall believe in your words, and come 
                   down into the depths of humility and be baptized, for they shall be visited with fire and with the Holy Ghost,
                    and shall receive a remission of their sins.

                 but if the salt shall lose its savor wherewith shall the earth be salted? The 
                 salt shall be thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men.
