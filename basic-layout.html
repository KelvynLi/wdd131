            <h3>Exploring a musical instrument</h3>
            <p>My first contact with the guitar was extremely difficult because I didn’t have much skill and struggled 
                to handle it properly. I didn’t know the notes, either. But over time, I learned that practice truly helps 
                us improve. If you want to learn to play an instrument, there’s nothing better than practicing regularly.</p>

            <h3>Visiting the church temple</h3>
            <p>Two months ago, I had a wonderful opportunity to travel to the temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
                 The experience was amazing. As a member of the Church, I had the chance to reflect on my covenants and help others as
                  well. The LDS temple is a peaceful place with stunning architecture—truly a sacred and inspiring environment.</p>

    I'm a good person who loves to travel and learn new things. My hobbies include
         playing guitar, going to church, and drinking tereré with friends. 
         I served as a missionary in the northeast of Brazil. I really enjoy
          singing and sometimes dancing too.
